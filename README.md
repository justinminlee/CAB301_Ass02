# CAB301_Ass02

# Description
'''
Understanding and application of non-linear data structures and algorithms, particularly in the development of reusable 
Abstract Data Types (ADTs). You are provided with two ADT specifications in C# interfaces, along with partially 
implemented ADT implementations. Your task is to complete the implementation of these ADTs by designing 
efficient algorithms to solve computational problems and analyzing their time efficiency.
'''
'''
The first ADT is called "Movie," representing a movie DVD in a library. 
It contains various attributes such as title, genre, classification, duration, 
total number of copies in the library, and the number of available DVDs. The second ADT is "MovieCollection," 
which is used to store and manipulate all the movies in the library. The underlying data structure used in the 
MovieCollection implementation is a Binary Search Tree (BST). Each node in the BST is represented by the 
inner class "BTreeNode" and contains references to left and right child nodes, as well as a Movie object.
'''

# Specific tasks

1. Design an efficient algorithm, using pseudocode notation, to find the total number of DVDs in the library. 
Empirically analyze the time efficiency of the algorithm and implement the method "public int NoDVDs()" in MovieCollection.cs 
based on this algorithm.

2. Complete the implementation of all the other incomplete methods in the ADT implementation skeletons (Movie.cs and MovieCollection.cs).

3. Design a test plan for each of the implemented methods.

4. Use the test plan to conduct comprehensive testing of each implemented method.

5. Write a technical report documenting your work. The report should include a cover page, table of contents, 
6. algorithm design and analysis, test plan, test data, and test results. References should also be included.
